***

ci-cleanup is a Bash script which searches through source files in a
CodeIgniter installation and interactively modifies the header and
footer for each file adherent to the CodeIgniter Style Guide, as in the
examples below.

Example header:
<?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

Example footer:
/* End of file Auth.php */
/* Location: ./application/libraries/Auth.php */

When a source file is found which deviates from this standard, the
relevant portion of the source file is displayed and the user is
presented with options to prepend/append the header/footer, edit the
file manually, append/prepend then edit, or do nothing.
